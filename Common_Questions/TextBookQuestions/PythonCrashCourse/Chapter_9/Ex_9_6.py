'''
9-6. Ice Cream Stand: An ice cream stand is a specific kind of restaurant. Write a class called IceCreamStand that
inherits from the Restaurant class you wrote in Exercise 9-1 (page 162) or Exercise 9-4 (page 167). Either version of
the class will work; just pick the one you like better. Add an attribute called flavors that stores a list of ice
cream flavors. Write a method that displays these flavors. Create an instance of IceCreamStand, and call this method.
